## Project Description with Vision Statement

### Project Description

Recipe Central is a software system that allows for people to write and share recipes. Users would be able to create posts with recipes, react to others, make comments, and possibly more. The software would group recipes based on key words/ titles- for example, if the recipe is vegan, there will be a subsection of recipes organized into a "Vegan" section, and the software will put other recipes of the same category into that section. If the recipe does not belong to a previously created section, the software will create a new section for the recipe. The recipes can also be tagged as easy, medium, or difficult on a level of how complicated it is to make the recipe. This can solve a problem of having trouble of finding an interactive recipe sharing platform, and is important in that recipes will be conveniently grouped and so easily findable and sharable for users. The system will have a main feed of recipes, based on those most recently added to the system. Users will be able to go through a common and a personalized feed, search through a search bar or through predetermined subsections, and post and share recipes. This software will be for anyone who wants be able to use an interactive recipe platform, whether they are trying to learn how to make new things or just continue to learn more recipes to share with others. Specifically, this would be a useful platform for in their 20s who are not the most experienced with cooking and who would like to find easy recipes to start learning how to make new things, and then to try more difficult recipes as they get the hang of it.
