# Guide to Contributing

## Team Norms
the project's values and team norms, including the definition of "done"

## Team Values

## Sprint Cadence

We will follow the cadence of the class; sprints will be 2 weeks each.

## Daily Standups

We will have daily standups for 5-10 minutes on the following schedule:
- Monday before class at 3:20pm
- Wednesday before class at 3:20pm

As per class/scrum instructions:
- we agree that members will not cover for other members who do not participate
- we agree that a member who makes no progress on a task for two standups or
  more in a row will be reported to management

## Git Workflow
Clone the repository
Create a new branch for individual task(s)
Modify the files (source code)
Name the commitment
Commit changes to individual branch
Create patch
Make a pull request
Merge the request if everything works alright

## Rules of Contributing
We will distribute task based on self-recommending first, this way we can gauge 
which parts of the task each member is most interested in doing and their 
comfortability. After taking this into account and looking for areas of synergy 
and overlap, we will then divide up the work equally and fairly to each team 
members in a way that each person feels comfortable with the work they are doing. 
Team members will be allowed to present further ideas over and above what they 
have been asked to do if their bandwidth allows, and this will be taken into 
account and implemented if the team agrees to.

## Conflict Resolve
Disagreement or conflicts will be resolved based on a fair and democratic process. 
We will attempt to identify the drivers of conflict versus only looking at the 
symptoms of the conflict. After assessing the cases of all the sides of the conflict, 
we will attempt to resolve amicably by finding common ground. If it is a fundamental 
difference in point of view, we will resort voting and the one with the most votes 
wins.

## Local Development Environment Setup
