# Guide to Contributing

## Team Norms

### Team Values

### Sprint Cadence

We will follow the cadence of the class; sprints will be 2 weeks each.

### Daily Standups

We will have daily standups for 5-10 minutes on the following schedule:
- Monday before class at 3:20pm
- Wednesday before class at 3:20pm

As per class/scrum instructions:
- we agree that members will not cover for other members who do not participate
- we agree that a member who makes no progress on a task for two standups or more in a row will be reported to management

### Coding standards

As described well in https://github.com/nyu-software-engineering/scrum-framework/blob/main/team-norms.md :

- Designate a code editor and code linter all team members will use to standardize code formatting
- Don't over-engineer. Write minimum code to get things working end to end, only then iterate to improve. - Code for each task and spike must be peer-reviewed and pass tests before merging into the main branch of code
- Always push working code, if you break the pipeline/build then fix it
- Make granular and small commits, per feature or per bug fix
- Provide descriptive commit messages
- Write self documenting code. Use descriptive variable and function names. Avoid unnecessary name shortening
- Don't leave dead/commented out code behind. If you see such code, delete it
- Write automated tests to cover critical integration points and functionality
